🃏 TRINITY DRAW 🎮

A minimalist card game of balance, chance, and intuition

Welcome to Trinity Draw — a fast-paced card duel where the goal isn’t to get the highest number, but the closest perfect balance. Every draw matters, and one extra card can either save you… or ruin everything.

🧠 Game Overview

Trinity Draw is a turn-based card game inspired by point-based casino games, where players compete to reach an optimal total without knowing exactly when to stop. Unlike traditional card games, both sides operate under strict limits that force risky decisions.

You face the House (the bot). Each round plays out in seconds, but the consequences can last much longer.

🎯 Objective

Get closer to the Target Value (9) than the House without exceeding it.

Go over the target, and you instantly lose the round — no second chances.

🔑 Core Rules & Mechanics

🃏 Card Values

Ace = 1

Cards 2–9 = face value

10, J, Q, K = 0

🎯 Target Value

The target number is 9

Only the last digit of your total counts (mod 10 rule)

🃏 Initial Draw

You and the House are dealt 2 cards

Totals are calculated immediately

➕ Third Card Option

If your total is 5 or below, you may choose to draw one additional card

The House follows its own fixed draw rules

⚖ Winning the Round

Closest total to 9 wins

Equal totals = tie

Exceeding 9 = automatic loss

❤️ Life System

Both players start with 5 lives

Losing a round = lose 1 life

First to reach zero lives loses the game

🛑 Exit Anytime

You may leave between rounds

Exiting ends the game without a winner
